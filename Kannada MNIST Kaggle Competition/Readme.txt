Feel free to run SVM.py

But When you wanna run CNN.py, you need to install and enable tensorflow_GPU to save computation time. If you sipmly run it on CPU, it is going to take very very long time!!!
A link to help you to enable GPU in Anaconda https://towardsdatascience.com/tensorflow-gpu-installation-made-easy-use-conda-instead-of-pip-52e5249374bc.

Thank you! Have a nice holiday!
